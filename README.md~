RPG Monocular Pose Estimation. ME495 HW2
#OBJECTIVES#



#PRELIMINARY STEPS#

Note: We are under the assumption that you have ROS set up and running on your system. The ROS version we are using is indigo.

1. Read the following publication by the developers of this package:

M. Faessler, E. Mueggler, K. Schwabe, D. Scaramuzza: **A Monocular Pose Estimation System based on Infrared LEDs.** IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), Hong Kong, 2014.

###SETTING UP MARKER_POSITIONS FILE###

Figuring out how to correctly input the XYZ values of each LED into the marker_positions file was the difficult part.

-Through some experimentation and reverse engineering of the image in the publication, we found that, though they had only 4 LED positions in the marker_positions file, there were actually 5 LEDs on the object.
-From this, we realized that one of the LEDs was actually the reference point from which the other LEDs were measured. This was the lowest LED on the object's frame of reference.
-Another important detail to note is that all of the LED position values should be given in meters

###REMAPPING NODES###

#RUNNING THE PACKAGE#

##RQT_RECONFIGURE##

###Dynamic Reconfigure###

When reconfiguring monocular_pose_estimator:

-Threshold: Needs to be within the range of 80-180 (From paper and experimentation)
-Gaussian sigma: We want the range within which it will not false-detect LEDs where they are not. This value needs to be at or below 1.7
-Minimum blob area: 39 seems to be the upper limit (on a scale to 0-100)
-Maximum blob area: 55 is lower limit (on a scale of 0-1000)
-Max width height distortion: 0.5 is lower limit (on scale of 0-1.0)
-Max circular distortion: 0.5 is lower limit (on scale of 0-1.0)
-Back projection pixel tolerance: 5.0 is lower limit (on scale of 0-10)
-Nearest neighbour pixel tolerance: 7.0, but other values seem to work- not noticeable difference to us (scale of 0-10)
-Certainty threshold: 0.5 is lower limit (on scale of 0-1)
-Valid correspondance: not a noticeable difference, so go with default of 0.7
-Roi border thickness: 10 on scale of 0-200
