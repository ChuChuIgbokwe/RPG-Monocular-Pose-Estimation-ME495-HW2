=======================================

RPG Monocular Pose Estimation. ME495 HW2
##OBJECTIVES#
* Use the ROS [camera calibration] (http://wiki.ros.org/camera_calibration) package to calibrate the webcam you are given
* Follow the documentation for the package to try and get the package running. You will need to do things like
 - Build some sort of 3D holder for your LEDs and calculate the transforms between them
 - Build a circuit for powering the LEDs
 - Fine-tune parameters of the tracking algorithm
* Build a ROS package to run the demo


##PRELIMINARY STEPS#
We decided to use the Microsoft LifeCam Studio wecam and we had issuses getting it to capture images

```lsusb
dmesg | tail
```

and run
```
sudo apt-get install gnome-media
gstreamer-properties
```
select video tab
select webcam device "test"
select video4linux (1) not (2) & "test"

this got our webcam to publish images as the default camera.
Remove the webcam and check see to your computers default webcam with 
```
cd /dev
ls
```

search for video and take note of the number after it. It will most likely be 0 or 1. Plug in your webcam and run 
```
ls
```

there will be another video term with a number after it. That is your webcamâ€™s ID.
install the [usb_cam ROS package] (http://wiki.ros.org/usb_cam) with
```
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-usb-cam
```
Check it installed properly with
```
dpkg -l | grep usb_cam
```

Note: We are under the assumption that you have ROS set up and running on your system. The ROS version we are using is indigo.
